 🖼️ AI Image Vault — Smart Storage for AI-Generated Images & Their Prompts

A lightweight, intuitive app designed to **save AI-generated images alongside their exact prompts**—so you never lose the recipe behind your favorite creations.

## 🎯 Purpose
Effortlessly archive:
- AI-generated images (from tools like Midjourney, DALL·E, Stable Diffusion, etc.)
- Their corresponding **positive**, **negative**, and **optional** prompts

## ✨ How It Works
1. **Copy** your AI-generated image to clipboard.
2. **Copy** the associated prompts (positive/negative/optional).
3. **Paste both** into the app’s upload section—simultaneously.
4. The app automatically saves the image and its prompts as a paired set in your custom output folder.

## 📂 Storage Structure
- Each image is saved with a unique timestamped name (e.g., `img_20251022_143022.png`)
- Prompts are saved in a `.txt` file with the same name
- All files are stored in your user-defined directory

## 🖼️ Smart Gallery
- The app scans your output folder and auto-detects image + prompt pairs
- View every image alongside its full prompt details in the gallery

> Built for artists, designers, and AI enthusiasts who want to organize their creative workflow and reuse winning prompts without guesswork.
